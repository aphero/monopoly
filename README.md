# The Personal Monopoly Wallet!

This is a banking app that is themed around the Monopoly game!  Yay!

## It does

Manages your finances as you travel the complex world of Monopoly.  Buying up property, paying taxes on property, winning the parking lot, passing go.  All of these things can be yours in Monopolyland wallet manager.

## It doesn't

Do all the things that normal mode required.  :(
I wanted to get the "total spent in a month" and "find the dude you spent the most on" methods, but ran into syntax demons.

## Estimate

I originally estimated 9 hours to complete normal mode.  Ended up spending close to 10 hours not completing it.
